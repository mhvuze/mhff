All of these scripts require Python 3.x

The data.py script can be used to extract files from the main DATA.BIN file
that's on the UMD of any Monster Hunter game. For Monster Hunter 3rd and 2nd G
you must first decrypt the DATA.BIN file.

The package.py script can be used to extract files from package files.

The tmh.py script can be used to extract textures from TMH files. Note that
this script is missing support for the DXT3 and DXT5 formats and has only been
tested on Monster Hunter Portable 3rd files.

The pmo.py script can be used to convert pmo models to Wavefront OBJ files.
Note that this script is still experimental and has only been tested on some
Monster Hunter Portable 3rd models.
